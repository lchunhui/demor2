Some notes on conducting causal mediation analysis with time-to-event outcomes. Since `gsem` from Stata did not support Cox as outcome model, [`regmedint`](https://kaz-yos.github.io/regmedint/) was utilized instead. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# install.packages('regmedint')
library(regmedint)
```
