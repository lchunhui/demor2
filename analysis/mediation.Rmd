Some notes on causal mediation analysis from VanderWeele's [materials](https://hsph.harvard.edu/research/vanderweele-lab/tools-and-tutorials).

## Traditional Approach

<ins>**Symbols**</ins>

* $A$: exposure of interest
* $M$: potential mediator
* $Y$: outcome
* $C$: baseline covariates

### The Difference Method

M1: a regression of the outcome $Y$ on the exposure $A$ and covariates $C$

<p style="text-align: center;">$E[Y|a, c] =$ $\phi_0$ $+$ $\phi_1a$ $+$ $\phi'_4c$</p>

$\phi_1$ is interpreted as the **total effect** (TE) of the exposure $A$ on the outcome $Y$.

<br/>

M2: similar but add the mediator $M$ in the regression as well

<p style="text-align: center;">$E[Y|a, m, c] =$ $\theta_0$ $+$ $\theta_1a$ $+$ $\theta_2m$ $+$ $\theta'_4c$</p>

$\theta_1$ is interpreted as the **direct effect** (DE) of $A$ on $Y$ when control has been made for the mediator.

The difference of TE and DE is interpreted as the **indirect effect** (IE), th effect of $A$ on $Y$ explaining by the mediator.

<p style="text-align: center;">$IE =$ $\phi_1$ $-$ $\theta_1$</p>

### The Product Method

Once again, M2 is employed.

M3: a regression of the mediator $M$ on the exposure $A$ and covariates $C$

<p style="text-align: center;">$E[M|a, c] =$ $\beta_0$ $+$ $\beta_1a$ $+$ $\beta'_2c$</p>

Then, substitute M3 in M2 for $m$.

<p style="text-align: center;">$E_M[E[Y|a, m, c]]$ 
<br/> $=$ $\theta_0$ $+$ $\theta_1a$ $+$ $\theta_2(\beta_0 + \beta_1a + \beta'_2c)$ $+$ $\theta'_4c$ <br/> $=$ $\theta_0$ $+$ $(\theta_1 + \theta_2\beta_1)a$ $+$ $(\theta_2\beta'_2c + \theta_2\beta_0 + \theta'_4c)$</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">$DE =$ $\theta_1$ <br/>
$IE =$ $\theta_2$$\beta_1$</p>

The interpretation of DE is the same as the difference method. The IE, however, is interpreted as the effect of the exposure on the mediator $\beta_1$ times the effect of the mediator on the
outcome $\theta_2$.

<ins>**Limitations**</ins>

* Two methosd differ in the case of binary outcome.
* Confounders for the mediator-outcome relationship may exist.

## Conterfactual Approach
